Welcome to the Exchange Health Checker Wiki!
======

The `Exchange Server Health Checker` script helps to detect common configuration issues that are known to cause performance issues and other long running issues that are caused by a simple configuration change within an Exchange environment.

It also helps collect useful information of your server to help speed up the process of common information gathering of your server.

This Wiki provides an overview about all the checks we perform during a run of the `Exchange Server Health Checker` script. The information provided here should help you to better understand the results and remediation steps to get the most out of your Exchange servers.
